.SH "NET POSITIONS"
If a host is not a member of any net position entries, it is placed in
the Grey Zone.  If a host is a member of multiple net position
entries, the first entry is used.  Line format for net position
entries is "pos net x\-position y\-position z\-position colour",
.br
eg. "pos 123.123.123.123/32 10 0 \-10 green".

.SH "START/STOP LOCAL SENSOR"
If sudo is required to start/stop a local sensor, the user starting
sensor0 must be in /etc/sudoers.  The default command to stop a local
sensor is "killall sensor0", which will kill all sensor0 processes.
.SH NOTES
Firewall configuration: By default, sensor0 talks to PacketZero via
UDP port 6333.  If sensor0 is running and PacketZero is not, ICMP Port
Unreachable (UDP port 6333) may be generated.  View syslog to assist
troubleshooting.  By default hosts are added from packet source IP
address, activate Add Destination Hosts to also add from destination
IP address.  Anomalies are a new host or host service.  Clicking a
host cluster will cycle through selecting hosts within.  Using the
menu options to move/arrange a few thousand hosts may take a few
minutes.
